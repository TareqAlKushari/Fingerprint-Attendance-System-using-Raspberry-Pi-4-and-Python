# Fingerprint Attendance System using Raspberry Pi 4 and Python
This project aims to design and implement a fingerprint-based attendance system for universities and institutions using biometric technology. The scope of this project includes:
Developing a software application that can enroll and verify fingerprints & store and retrieve attendance data from a database.
Using a fingerprint sensor, a Raspberry Pi 4, and some Python libraries and modules to create the hardware and software components of the system.
Testing the functionality and performance of the system in terms of accuracy, speed, and usability.

## Introduction
The fingerprint attendance system is a project that aims to develop a reliable and efficient way of recording and managing the attendance of students or employees using fingerprint sensors and a Raspberry Pi. The system uses the Adafruit Fingerprint Sensor, a capacitive fingerprint scanner that can store up to 127 fingerprints and communicate with the Raspberry Pi via the serial port. The system also uses an LCD to show the name and status of the person who scanned their fingerprint, and a CSV file to store and retrieve the attendance data.
